# Armv8.x-A and the SBSA

The `Server Base System Architecture (SBSA)`, provides `hardware requirements for servers`. 

The SBSA ensures that `operating systems`, `hypervisors` and `firmware` operate correctly. 

For servers, where a degree of `standardization is important`, the SBSA includes rules on which 
extensions to the `architecture must be implemented`.

The following table summarizes the SBSA requirements that relate to the Armv8.x-A extensions:

#  Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR) specification

This `Server Base Boot Requirements (SBBR)` specification is intended for `SBSA-compliant 64-bit Armv8 servers`.
It defines the `base firmware requirements` for out-of-box support of any `Arm SBSA-compatible` Operating System or
`hypervisor`. The requirements in this specification are intended to be `minimal yet complete` for booting a multi-core
Armv8 server platform`, while leaving plenty of room for OEM or ODM innovations and design details.
